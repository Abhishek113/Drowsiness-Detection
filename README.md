# Drowsiness-Detection
The project aims to detect the drowsiness of the driver. I have uploaded the prototype of the project.

First you have to install Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Scipy and Dlib library.
Ther was an error of Scipy for me and hence I have design a fuction to calculate eclidian distance by my own.
You can directly use the function from Scipy for calculating clidian distance as follows:

from Scipy import distance as dist
dist.dist.euclidean(<point 1>,<point 2>)
